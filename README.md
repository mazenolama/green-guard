# Overview

Over the centuries the growth of agriculture contributed to the rise of civilizations. About 11,500 years ago, people gradually learned how to grow grains and crops. By 2000 years, much of the population became dependent on agriculture. and based on that, agricultural inventions have greatly increased food production. Also, Agricultural development is one of the most powerful tools to end extreme poverty, boost shared prosperity and feed a projected 9.7 billion people by 2050. Growth in the agriculture sector is two to four times more effective in raising incomes among the poorest compared to other sectors. Analyses in 2016 found that 65 per cent of poor working adults made a living through agriculture. Agriculture is also crucial to economic growth: in 2018, it accounted for 4 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP) and in some developing countries, it can account for more than 25% of GDP

## Project Idea

IoT is a new and **upcoming** trend in **technology** that finds its application in almost every field. Things, when connected to the internet and to each other, make the entire system smart. We have used IoT in every way of life: Smart Cities, Smart homes, Smart retail and many more. 

So **based** on that we decided to build an ecosystem for agriculture field that monitoring, capturing and integrating data of crops, to deliver the intelligent to different parts of the agriculture industry. 
It will help to drive productivity, minimize the time, and will be include on a system for enhanced decision making. Can be controlled and monitor from anywhere in the world (IoT).
